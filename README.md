# [MCCW] Minimal Customizable Character Wallpaper
**A wallpaper made with love, back in 2019.**


## Summary
This wallpaper was made in 2019, reworked and now this version (v2.0.2) has been uploaded here on Github.
You fork it, customize it to your liking and create Pull Requests to update the original that is uploaded on Wallpaper Engine!
This means that this wallpaper is now community driven, and you can maintain it alive for as long as your coding desires need.

It used to run an online service created by a friend and I, called Steroid. Now it's long gone and dead due to lack of support from the community.

## Rules
There are indeed certain rules to follow, otherwise this would be a mess!

  - Use English.
  - Keep your code organized and well explained.
  - Do not upload your own third party libraries.
  - Do not rework the entire wallpaper without thinking about the other community members.
  - Functionality must be added, or enhanced, if removed, you must offer something better.
  - If you plan to bring some sort of online service, it will be denied! We do not know what you can do with our data.

Those are the basic rules, along the way I will complain anyways.

Have fun!
